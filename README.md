# pedantrs
A Rust linter, purely for educational purposes. I have implemented the following
lints:

* (WARN) Check that the number of arguments accepted to each function is not
  excessively large.
* (WARN) Check that public constants are documented.
* (WARN) Check that functions don't use overly deep nesting of expressions
* (WARN) Check that private functions, traits, impls, modules, enums and structs
  are documented.
